# Project-FAST-and-MODERN-Python-API-with-FastAPI

PROJECT:
Write an api you Enter  your location and it will let you :Umbrella  yes or no !
( it is used a  live data and it will determine if itâ€™s rainig now its   not using a forcast )
It is built a little iot thing and its just like e-ink and it sits on our dest and shows an or a  hat 
We are using a real data 




FastAPi:
+ modern features: type hints , async(This means MODERN)/await , ASGi server,g unicorn , uvicorn type servers , they need asynchronous server geteway interface , Data classes , pydentic (nice to exchange and validate data )
It has all the mechanism and capabilities to be on par with Django , flask , pyramid as well  , it renders tips templates  , dynamic template like jinja or chameleon as a open source project extension , it does static files and all those kinds

Modern python web framework
Def async some method , use type hints in a way that are meaningful and write moden python code 

FastAPI is a modern framework for creating Python APIs using standard Python type hints. It is a batteries-included framework that comes with all the necessary features and tools you need to create a production-ready API.



The major difference between FastAPI and Flask is in how they are used. While the Flask framework is for prototyping new applications and ideas, the FastAPI framework is for building APIs. It offers various options for building a backend server quickly without the need for coding experience.

In conclusion, Django is perfect if you want to build robust full-stack web applications because it has several functionalities and works very well in production. On the other hand FastAPI is perfect if you're looking for high performance or scalable applications.
